# OCR-using-Python
Optical Character Recognition(OCR) is the conversion of images of typed or handwritten text into machine-encoded text.

The "ocr_final.py" file when executed opens a file opening dialog box through which an image file is to be selected which contains the text.
On selecting the image file the output text generated is printed on the console.
